!! MAIN FILE IS HOME.HTML !!

Available functions:
- General Google UI
- Search Functions complete
    + "fullscreen" will result in the Fullscreen Media website being first
- Local hosting (currently using port 4444)

Steps for running local browser:
1. Run geckodriver.exe in "../FullScreenQAChall/webdriverComponents"
2. Run test.js 'node test.js' in same directory
3. Run home.html in opened browser

============================
In development:
1. Sign in authentication using cucumber.js
    - Though Gherkin Language is self-explanatory, the functions bit is evading me.

Remaining questions:
1. I understand the concept behind webdriver, but how exactly do you implement it without looking at a tutorial?
